>>>>> ##### .obj rendering with OpenGL 4.1

##### Grade ``(TBD/100)`` ``(TBD/125)*``
--------  -----------------------


##### Goals:
- [X] Code in `C`, observing 42's norm (see below)
- [X] Use modern OpenGL, >=4.0 with shaders
- [X] Parse and render a `.obj` file
- [X] Rotation around y axis
- [X] Apply grey shades on each faces
- [X] Apply a texture on the object
- [X] No math/3d library allowed

##### Recommended bonus:
- [X] Handle any .obj
- [X] Smart texture projection

##### My work:
- [X] Watched a course from `UC Davis` on youtube (see below)
- [X] Read `Learn OpenGL` website (see below)
- [X] Used `GLFW` for window handling
- [X] Matrix operations
- [X] Randomly generated land at startup. Built on GPU
- [X] Blinnâ€“Phong single source lighting. Represented with a movable yellow sun
- [X] Shadows with depth cubemap
- [X] Tesselation on sun from a tetrahedron to a sphere. (Automatic or controls with keyboard)
- [X] Tesselation on land from {color,height,normal}maps generated at startup
- [X] Advanced mesh processing
- [X] Multiple texture projections
- [X] Dynamic controls for object/textures/texture-projection-mode/mesh-processing/camera-potion/object-position/sun-position/sun-tesselation

- [ ] No more than 80 characters per lines.
- [ ] At most 5 functions per files.
- [ ] Only 1 declaration per line.  
- [ ] No declaration and assignation on the same line.
- [ ] At most 1 assignation per line.
- [ ] No more than 4 parameters for a function.
